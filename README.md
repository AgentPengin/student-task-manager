## 💻 Project Introduction

### a. Overview

✍️ [Student Task Manager (TimeStream) is a lightweight web application built to help students stay on top of assignments, deadlines, and study sessions. Its core feature is the Quick-add prompt, which turns natural language input into structured tasks (e.g., Math HW due tomorrow 17:00 ~90m #math p2). The app includes a Calendar view for visualizing tasks over time, a Focus mode to minimize distractions during study, and is designed to be extendable with AI-powered suggestions for task prioritization and study planning. With a clean, responsive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile, the app leverages React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind]
